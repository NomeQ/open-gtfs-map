## Week 3 Report
I have perhaps been ambitious in learning a new framework for this project. Thus far I have:
- Completed several node js tutorials/practice projects at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs and https://nodeschool.io/
- Started planning project with classic pen and paper
- Made overall structural and strategic decisions
- Thinkin' bout data structures
